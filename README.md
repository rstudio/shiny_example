This is a editing version of shiny r server example. the source file is adapted from Shiny exmaple. 



# Example Shiny app

This is an example application for Shiny.
The main purpose of this example is to illustrate how to run Shiny apps from a remote source.
There are many ways to download and run it:

```R
library(shiny)

# Easiest way is to use runGitHub
runGitHub("shiny_example", "rstudio")

# Run a tar or zip file directly
runUrl("https://github.com/rstudio/shiny_example/archive/master.tar.gz")
runUrl("https://github.com/rstudio/shiny_example/archive/master.zip")
```

Or you can clone the git repository, then use `runApp()`:

```R
# First clone the repository with git. If you have cloned it into
# ~/shiny_example, first go to that directory, then use runApp().
setwd("~/shiny_example")
runApp()
```


To run a Shiny app from a subdirectory in the repo or zip file, you can use the `subdir` argument. This repository happens to contain another copy of the app in `inst/shinyapp/`.

```R
runGitHub("shiny_example", "rstudio", subdir = "inst/shinyapp/")

runUrl("https://github.com/rstudio/shiny_example/archive/master.tar.gz",
  subdir = "inst/shinyapp/")
```
